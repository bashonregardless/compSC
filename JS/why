---> Enter key fires both click event and keypress (when multiple events are attached to button)?
A. [Refer: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3907#issuecomment-107247839] 
  [Refer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/57437473/11320006]

  Buttons are type="submit" by default in HTML, and pressing enter simulates a click on the button. This is standard HTML behavior, not specific to React.

  On button focus
  if you pressed any key except (space and enter) only the keypress event will fire

   But
  if you focus the button and press space or enter this will fire both the events because this is a browser default behavior also for this same reason e.preventDefault() solved the problem for you.

Q. Using regular expression to split lines with different line endings/ends
 of line/line breaks?

 [Refer: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp#using_regular_expression_to_split_lines_with_different_line_endingsends_of_lineline_breaks]

 NOTE Windows is \r\n for a new line.
 Note that the order of the patterns in the regular expression matters.
