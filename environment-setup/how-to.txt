---> How to safely shell script in a safe environment?
A.  NOTE on Safety and Security:
	(REFER https://askubuntu.com/questions/1141064/how-can-i-test-a-shell-script-in-a-safe-environment-to-avoid-harm-to-my-comput)
	
	If you're not sure what a script does, you're better off not
	running it until you are sure what it does. Ways to reduce the 
	damage radius of a bad script include running it using a new 
	user, running it in a container, or running it in a virtual machine. 
	But that first statement still holds: If you're not sure what 
	something does, consider not running it until you do.
	
	Next action: Installing VM(or, some kind of sandbox), to avoid
	polluting my host system.
	
	If you want to inspect the script for malware, this is not 
	an effective solution. This is a way of testing the functionality 
	without polluting your host system.
	
	This approach is not safe, because, After you've run the script in the 
	sandbox, how are you going to tell whether it was safe? It 
	might have harmful effects that you can't easily say. Malware 
	doesn't necessarily pop up and say "Haha, got you!". Also,
	a malicious script could easily behave in a benign way while 
	in a sandbox or VM and then behave maliciously on your real 
	computer. (For instance, VM detection is a thing, as is machine 
	fingerprinting.)  


---> How to install a Virtual Machine/VM?
A. Using "Multipass" VM
	[Refer: https://multipass.run/in]
	[Refer: https://github.com/canonical/multipass]

---> How to list available multipass commands?
A. `multipass --help`

---> How to list multipass instance info?
A. `multipass info [instance name]`
	Here you will find the IPv4 address of your instance.

---> How to copy files from one machine to another machine/server?
A. `scp shell-scripts/environment-setup.sh ubuntu@10.66.53.250:~/.`
	or, more generally,
	`scp source target`
	where,
	The source and target may be specified as a local pathname, a remote host with optional path in the form [user@]host:[path],
	or a URI in the form scp://[user@]host[:port][/path].  Local file names can be made explicit using absolute or relative 
	pathnames to avoid scp treating file names containing ‘:’ as host specifiers.

	---> How to set up remote ssh authentication?
	A. [Refer: https://kb.iu.edu/d/aews]
		Generate RSA keys, on the command line 
		`ssh-keygen -t rsa`

		Important: If you don't password-protect your private key, anyone with access to your computer conceivably can 
		SSH (without being prompted for a password) to your account on any remote system that has the corresponding public key.

	---> How to copy the public key file (for example, ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to your account on the remote system ?
	A. `scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ubuntu@10.66.53.250:~/.`
		where,
		first arg is the location/pathname of the pub key.

		or,
		`ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ubuntu@10.66.53.250`

---> How to copy files from/to a Linux VM?
A. [Research: https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/vmhandbook/doc/copy-file-linux.html]
	Downloading files from your home directory on the login node to your home directory on your local machine is a similar process as shown below:

	Download the file ~/yourFile.xyz to your home directory on your computer:
	`scp username@cerzheprd03.its.auckland.ac.nz:~/yourFile.xyz ~/.`

	Download the folder yourFolder to your home directory on your computer:
	`scp -r username@cerzheprd03.its.auckland.ac.nz:~/yourFolder ~/.`

---> How to solve the "ubuntu@10.66.53.250: Permission denied (publickey)." error on trying to ssh or scp?
A. [Refer: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ssh-permission-denied-publickey#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20to%20use,login%20in%20the%20sshd_config%20file.&text=In%20the%20file%2C%20find%20the,disable%20it%20by%20adding%20no%20.]
	`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
	In the file, find the PasswordAuthentication line and make sure it ends with yes.
	Find the ChallengeResponseAuthentication option and disable it by adding no.
	Restart the SSH service by typing the following command: `sudo systemctl restart sshd`

	--> What if there is password prompted when you ssh/scp to remote and the remote passwd is unknown?
	A. Set the remote passwd. You should have access to remote.

---> How to set passwd from command line?
A. `sudo passwd ubuntu`

----> How to not quit the terminal when executing the script with a command like this
  `. script.sh`?
A. The "problem" really is that you're sourcing and not executing the script. When you source a file,
  its contents will be executed in the current shell, instead of spawning a subshell. So everything,
  including exit, will affect the current shell.

  Instead of using exit, you will want to use return.
  or,
  execute it with `bash script` command.
