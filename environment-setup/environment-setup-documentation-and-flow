-------------

The para below has been copied from the origin ~/.profile file:

~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.
This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
exists.
see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.
the files are located in the bash-doc package.

the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
umask 022

-------------

In our case we are including the ~/.bash_profile file, therefore bypassing ~/.profile file.

--------------

We are also copying the existing code in the ~/.profile file to our ~/.bash_profile file.
The reason is that we want to set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists,
which could be present at path $HOME/bin or $HOME/.local/bin, and if running bash also
include .bashrc if it exists.
