!One of the more irritating differences between keyboards is the location of the Control and CapsLock keys.  A common use of xmodmap is to swap these two keys as follows:
!
! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L
!
!
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Control_L
keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L

!This example can be run again to swap the keys back to their previous assignments.
