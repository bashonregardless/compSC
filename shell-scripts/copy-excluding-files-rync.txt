(REFER: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-exclude-files-and-directories-with-rsync/)
command:
  rsync -a --exclude-from='exc-p.txt' src_dir/* dest_dir/

NOTES:
  --exclude-from=FILE     read exclude patterns from FILE

For eg:
  Suppose the contents of exc-p.txt file be:
  "
  .git
  node_modules
  dist/*
  "

  If you want to exclude the directory .git and node_modules
  and
  If you want to exclude the directory content but not the 
  directory itself use dist/* instead of dist.
