  /dev/null is a virtual device that always discards the data written to it. When we
  want to eliminate the standard output or error of a shell command, we can
  redirect it to this file. Reads from this device always return end-of-file.

  Note that $variable is actually a simplified form of ${variable}.
  In contexts where the $variable syntax causes an error, the longer form may work.

  hello="A B  C   D"
  echo $hello   # A B C D
  echo "$hello" # A B  C   D
  # As we see, echo $hello   and   echo "$hello"   give different results.
