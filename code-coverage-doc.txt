Q. What is test coverage?
A. Using the code coverage metric is a technique that helps to improve the test suite and the software itself.
   Learn how much of your code is covered by tests, but it is also possible to find out what exact parts of the codebase are not covered well enough.
   Tools also make it possible to generate code coverage reports in HTML format that you can then view in your browser.

   Value:
	It makes it much easier to inspect the areas of code that are missing tests and are likely to need some improvements as well.
