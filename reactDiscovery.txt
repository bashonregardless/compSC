  components re render if parent detects a change in state. This behaviour in irrespective of whether child component consumes these states or not. Parent re rendering causes entire child tree to re render.

  Reconciliation:
	engagementPortal MessageList - added { key = {message.id} }
					 Message - shouldComponentUpdate() {}
	Surprising behaviour - Message component ( old Messages ) do not re render only when both the above code is included. Why?
						   Idealy key Diffing should work alone.
